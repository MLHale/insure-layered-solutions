# Progress Report 3/26/2018
## Overview

will need to write a brief overview in paragraph form

## Outcomes

  Efforts made (please add to list as needed)
  
  1. Completed research
  2. Completed [python script](https://github.com/MLHale/insure-layered-solutions/blob/master/python/layeredSolutionsClasses.py) to scrape cert.org vulnerability database
  3. Determined approach to deal with unknown patch dates

## Hinderances

* Coming up with an accepted approach to dealing with unknown patch dates
* Learning BeautifulSoup and parsing the results obtained to receive relevant data from the python script

## Ongoing Risks

| Risk Name (value) | Impact | Likelihood | Description |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Programming issues (64) | 8 | 8 | Any programming issues with the HTML webpage or the Python program will slow progress. |
|    Unable to find exploit and patch dates (63)        | 9 | 7 | If exploit and patch dates cannot be found or incorrect, the final results in the timeline will be off. |
| No vulnerability overlaps in timeline (56) | 8 | 7 | Problems could arise if the vulnerability timeline is not showing overlaps properly.    |
| Problems gathering data (18) | 6 | 3 | Any major issues scraping databases for information will not allow for the rest of the project to continue until data can be retrieved. |
| Team member availability (15) | 5 | 3 | Team members must be able to coordinate appropriate times to meet otherwise progress will be slowed. |
| CVEs not found (12) | 6 | 2 | The project will not work if relevant CVEs cannot be found for the Enterprise VPN solutions that have been chosen |
