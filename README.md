The Impact of Known Vulnerabilities on Layered Solutions Team Project
## Executive Project Summary
The purpose of layered solutions is to give the ability of an institution to use layered commercial products to deliver access to their critical data while maintaining security.  Traditionally, government devices were designed and certified to be used to access their most sensitive data.  This is extremely costly and time consuming.  Recently, the government has been reviewing proposals which would utilize commercial devices to deliver the same results as the government devices.  To increase the governments assurance, the government is attempting to ascertain if the use of multiple or layered solutions will provide the level of assurance that a government device would deliver.

This task will attempt to determine the security benefit of using layered solutions in an institution and if it affords any advantages.  The two layers being investigated will be enterprise vpn solutions.  It will be prudent to research the National Vulnerability Database and the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposes database in order to create a timeline of vulnerabilities for enterprise solutions over the years at varying code levels.  It will be important to distinguish between the time the vulnerability is known and the time when the patch is released.  There is also another aspect to take into account.  It cannot be assumed that when the patch is released, that this will be the time that the institutions devices would be patched.  There will need to be a patch window, in which, an institution would review, test, and assign the patch to a change management request.  The research will need to be limited to only vulnerabilities that could possibility compromise a security layer.  The timeline will be developed to aid in displaying overlapping vulnerabilities of the layered solutions selected, if they exist.

It will be also important to ascertain the possibility of an adversaries' ability to compromise layered solutions that do not have overlapping timelines.  This would involve an adversary's ability to compromise one layer and then wait until the other solution has a new vulnerability known to it.  History has shown, in many cases adversaries will gain some access and sit and wait until another opportunity presents itself.  

Lastly, it will be important to research how long it takes an exploit to be created once the vulnerability is known.  This information will be easily identified as the timeline is created with vulnerabilities, patches and available exploits of vpn solutions. It will be important to also point out if there have been successful exploits of these vulnerabilities, not just hypothesized exploits that should be possible.

This is type of research is extremely important to all institutions to help protect sensitive data and mitigate the adversaries' ability to breach their network.  By compiling all of this data and creating a timeline to analyze this data, the hope is to provide useful information to confirms or denies the advantage of introducing layered solutions into an institutions network security posture.

## Risk list
|Risk Name (value)  | Impact     | Likelihood | Description |
|-------------------|------------|------------|-------------|
|CVEs not found (12) | 6 | 2 | The project will not work if relevant CVEs cannot be found for the Enterprise VPN solutions that have been chosen.  |
|Programming issues (64) | 8 | 8 | Any programming issues with the HTML webpage or the Python program will slow progress.  |
|No vulnerability overlap in timeline (56) | 8 | 7 | Problems could arise if the vulnerability timeline is not showing overlaps properly.  |
|Unable to find exploit and patch dates (63) | 9 | 7 | If exploit and patch dates cannot be found or are incorrect, the final results in the timeline will be off.  |
|Problems gathering data (18) | 6 | 3 | Any major issues scraping databases for information will not allow for the rest of the project to continue until data can be retrieved.  |
|Team member availability (15) | 5 | 3 | Team members must be able to coordinate appropriate times to meet otherwise progress will be slowed.  |
